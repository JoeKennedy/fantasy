                    <p .list-group-item-text>
                        As an overview, weighted scoring is a way to assure that
                        \ important actions relative to the plot, action, or
                        \ fictional universe, i.e. Snape killing Dumbledore
                        \ (wait, wrong series), are <i>weighted</i> more
                        \ heavily than unimportant actions, like Gimli or
                        \ Legolas killing a random
                        \ Orc (shoot, different wrong series).

                <li .list-group-item>
                    <h6 .list-group-item-heading>How does weighted scoring work?
                    <p .list-group-item-text>
                        Each action, like a kill or an insult, rather than
                        \ being just X number of points, now has a weight,
                        \ which is calculated as the percent of points the
                        \ primary character
                        \ (in the case of single character actions) or the
                        \ receiving character (in the case of multi-character
                        \ actions) has accrued over the course of the series up
                        \ to the moment the action happened.

                <li .list-group-item>
                    <h6 .list-group-item-heading>
                        Can I have an example for a single character action?
                    <div .list-group-item-text>
                        <p> Up-to-date show watchers should remember (spoiler
                            \ alert) when Lady Selyse Baratheon, wife of the
                            \ (probably?) late Stannis Baratheon, hung herself
                            \ after Stannis sentenced their daughter to death.
                            \ We'll use her suicide as the only action for our
                            \ example, just to keep is simple.
                        <p> Let's say that up until that episode in season 5,
                            \ Lady Selyse had earned 180 points using the
                            \ scoring settings for your league here. Obviously
                            \ we're being insanely generous with points for her
                            \ character, as she rarely does cool stuff. We'll
                            \ also say that your scoring settings for the
                            \ SUICIDE action are as follows:
                        <dl .dl-horizontal>
                            <dt>Points
                            <dd>-20
                            <dt>Weight %
                            <dd>-35
                        <p> With these settings, Lady Selyse would lose 20
                            \ points for killing herself, plus an additional 35%
                            \ of her 180 points, which comes out to 63 points.
                            \ This means that Lady Selyse committing suicide
                            \ would result in the following point allocation:
                        <dl .dl-horizontal>
                            <dt>Selyse Baratheon
                            <dd>-83 points

                        <p> As an example, let's go with the moment that
                            \ (spoiler alert)
                            <strong .text-primary>Roose Bolton

                            \ at the Red Wedding. To keep things simple, let's
                            \ focus only on the kill for now.
                            \ Obviously, this is an
                            \ important moment in the show, since it marks the

                        <p> Now, let's say that over the

                            \ and you have the KILL point/weight settings to be:

                        <dl .dl-horizontal>

                            <dd>-50

                        <p> With these settings,

                            would score 10
                            \ points for the kill, and then <i>additionally</i>
                            \ get 25% of

                            \ however, would lose 15

                        Why don't some actions have weights?

                        <p> Some actions, like those related to drinking, aren't
                            \ more important when done by, say, Tyrion Lannister
                            \ than by an unnamed Stark bannerman. Sure, it's fun
                            \ to see Tyrion drunk, but the actual act of him
                            \ taking or pouring a drink is, for the most part,
                            \ inconsequential to the plot's big picture.
                        <p> As you can probably see, we've deemed <i>most</i>
                            \ single character actions as inconsequential, as
                            \ only a few of them have weights by default.
                            \ However, we've allowed all weights to be
                            \ adjustable, because it's up to you to decide
                            \ how your league is scored.
